Marvelous MLOps End-to-end MLOps with Databricks course

## Week-1


Use the dataset housing-prices

<!-- [Diamonds](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds?resource=download)
Analyze diamonds by their cut, color, clarity, price, and other attributes -->

## Practical information
- Weekly lectures on Wednesdays 16:00-18:00 CET.
- Code for the lecture is shared before the lecture.
- Presentation and lecture materials are shared right after the lecture.
- Video of the lecture is uploaded within 24 hours after the lecture.

- Every week we set up a deliverable, and you implement it with your own dataset.
- To submit the deliverable, create a feature branch in that repository, and a PR to main branch. The code can be merged after we review & approve & CI pipeline runs successfully.
- The deliverables can be submitted with a delay (for example, lecture 1 & 2 together), but we expect you to finish all assignments for the course before the 25th of November.


## Set up your environment
In this course, we use Databricks 15.4 LTS runtime, which uses Python 3.11.
In our examples, we use UV. Check out the documentation on how to install it: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/

To create a new environment and create a lockfile, run:

```
uv venv -p 3.11 venv
source venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml --all-extras
uv lock
```

## 📊 Weekly Development Progress

### Week 1: Data Preparation and Preprocessing

✨ Key Features:

- Comprehensive  `DataProcessor` class for house price dataset preparation
     - The  `DataProcessor` class handles all aspects of preparing house price data for ML:
        - Initialization: Takes a pandas DataFrame, configuration object, and SparkSession
        - Preprocessing: Handles missing values, data type conversion, and feature selection
        - Data Splitting: Divides data into training and test sets
        - Catalog Integration: Saves processed data to Databricks tables with timestamps
        - Delta Lake Features: Enables Change Data Feed for data versioning

- **Key Methods**
- preprocess() --
Converts numeric columns using pd.to_numeric()
Handles missing values in "LotFrontage" and "GarageYrBlt"
Creates derived feature "GarageAge" from "GarageYrBlt"
- split_data() -- Divides processed data into training and test sets. Configurable test size and random state parameters
Returns separate pandas DataFrames for train and test
- save_to_catalog() -- Converts pandas DataFrames to Spark DataFrame.
- enable_change_data_feed() -- Enables Delta Lake's Change Data Feed feature on train and test tables. Supports advanced data versioning and change tracking capabilities
